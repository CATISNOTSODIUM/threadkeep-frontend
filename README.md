# ThreadKeep ⬢  - Your personal archive for online conversations.

**ThreadKeep** is a web forum where people can create online forums. It's designed to be easy to use, and a special feature lets users easily pull out the most important information from other people's forums. This project was developed as a part of CVWO Assignment for the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).

This is the **frontend** repository. For backend repository, please visit [here](https://github.com/CATISNOTSODIUM/threadkeep-backend).

## Introduction
While most of the forum discussion platforms available today allow users can engage in conversations by posting messages, sharing information, asking questions, and interacting with others on a variety of topics, retrieving information from the thread can only be done in only one way, retrieving information from the thread can only be done in one way: manually dragging the relevant part from the post and copying it into the clipboard. For instance, for the thread about solving a coding problem, the most relevant information is the code snippet. Imagine users having to retrieve information from multiple threads; manually copying one by one can be tedious.

This project aims to solve this problem by integrating a built-in data retrieval system. Inspired by an online-shopping platform, where users click on products into their shopping carts and pay for them in a single click, this web forum allows users to filter irrelevant information from multiple threads and retrieve the information at once.
